Use dupfinder to find duplicate files in big archives of files.
Dupfinder searches the given path for files, creates a hash database for
all files and searches for files which have the same hash.

Dupfinder can be used to search for duplicate pictures in huge picture
collections for example.

Good Luck, Jens
