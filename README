Use dupfinder to find duplicate files in big archives of files.
Dupfinder searches the given path for files, creates a hash database for
all files and searches for files which have the same hash. So if you
have a picture or video with 2 diffenrent names or in different folders,
you can identify them and create an archive script and a delete script.

Dupfinder can be used to search for duplicate pictures in huge picture
collections for example.

Examples:

1) To search duplicate files in path /tmp/picture use:

	> ./dupfinder -avr /tmp/Pictures

   3 files will be created:
	> filelist.db - list of files in root path
	> filehash.db - list of all files with every hash value
	> duplicates.db - list of duplicate files in
			
2) To get help for all options use:

	> ./dupfinder -h
	
3) To generate 2 scripts which can be used to archive the duplicates to
   an archive folder and to delete the duplicates use:
   
	> ./dupfinder -g
	
   2 scripts will be generated:
   
	> copy_dups_from_root_path_to_archive.sh 
   
   This script which will copy all duplicates in root path to
   an archive folder in your current directory called "duplicates".
   
   	> delete_dups_from_root_path.sh
	
   This script can be used to delete all duplicate files from the
   root path. If you want to exclude several folders, you can modify
   the script with grep for example.
   The delete script contents only the duplicates. If there are 3
   similar files, the delete script will only have 2 of them deleted.
   
   Just have a look into the delete script:
   
   > tail delete_dups_from_root_path.sh 
     rm -v '/tmp/2015/921.JPG'
     rm -v '/tmp/2015/.thumbs/923.JPG'
     
   If you don't want to delete file from the thumbnail folders, create
   a new script:
   
   > grep -v ".thumbs" > delete_dups_from_root_path_custom.sh

Good Luck, Jens
