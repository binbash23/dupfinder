Use dupfinder to find duplicate files in big archives of files.
Dupfinder searches the given path for files, creates a hash database for
all files and searches for files which have the same hash.

Dupfinder can be used to search for duplicate pictures in huge picture
collections for example.

Example:

1) To search duplicate files in path /tmp/picture use:

	> ./dupfinder -avr /tmp/Pictures

   3 files will be created:
	> filelist.db - list of files in root path
	> filehash.db - list of all files with every hash value
	> duplicates.db - list of duplicate files in
			
2) To get help for all options use:

	> ./dupfinder -h
	
3) To generate 2 scripts which can be used to archive the duplicates to
   an archive folder and to delete the duplicates use:
   
	> ./dupfinder -g
	
   2 scripts will be generated:
   
	> copy_dups_from_root_path_to_archive.sh 
   
   This script which will copy all duplicates in root path to
   an archive folder called "duplicates"
   
   	> delete_dups_from_root_path.sh
	
   This script can be used to delete all duplicate files from the
   root path. If you want to exclude several folders, you can modify
   the script with grep for example.

Good Luck, Jens
